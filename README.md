# Go Projects Repository

This repository contains my working Go (Golang) projects and practice files. It serves as a collection of programs and experiments that showcase my learning and development in the Go programming language.

## Contents

- `main.go` and other Go source files demonstrating basic syntax, data types, and control structures.
- Small projects and practice exercises covering topics like:
  - Functions and methods
  - Loops and conditionals
  - Arrays, slices, and maps
  - Structs and interfaces
  - File handling and input/output
  - Concurrency with goroutines and channels (if included)

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to track my progress in Go, experiment with different programming concepts, and build a portfolio of Go projects for learning and reference.
